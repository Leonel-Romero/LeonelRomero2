His main objectives are to improve understanding of wave-current interactions and their impacts on surface wave breaking, air-sea fluxes, and applications. Other research interests include the transport and dispersion of tracers near the ocean surface and the underlying driving processes such as winds, waves, fronts, eddies, and Langmuir circulation.
